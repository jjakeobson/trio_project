<h2>DOINKLR E-COMMERCE CLONE</h2>
This was our project after week 4 of Wyncode. We were to create an E-Commerce (Amazonish) clone. The name of our website was DOINKLR, the silk road for pets! We had a fun time coming up with the materials but it was meant to be silly (and fictional) just to prove the point of how far we had come in just a month! Built in rails using html, and css. Integration with the Stripe API as well as a full functional shopping cart, comment, and inventory system.
